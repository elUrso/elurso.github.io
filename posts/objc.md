# Objective-C

I'm a big fan of learning different programming languages and in this post I
 keep some notes on my Obj-C studies.

## It is not only Objective, but also C!

Being a superset of C, Obj-C holds a great advantage in terms of achieving
 high performance where it is needed.
C is a dangerous language for begginers and this is just part of the game.
Some tools requires pratice and time, Objective-C adds little overhead and
 a bunch of flexibility into the language, so I say that is a valuable extra
 tool for most of C programmers that would like something different from C++.

Do not forget the complete access to all of those C libraries floating around,
that combos well with the easy of use to create a C API to your Obj-C code.

## Objectively Smalltalk

Obj-C is very Apple centric today. Which is better than being a dead language.
And the first thing most people will find about it is written in the first
 sentence of it's Wikipedia Article:

> [Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that 
 adds _Smalltalk-style_ messaging to the
 C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)

Be sure to learn about Smalltalk and Objetive-C history. It's valuable info.
But if you want just a demo to get the felling of Smalltalk, check this

## Thanks Brad

Brad Cox passed away in early 2021. Being the creator of Obj-C, his vision
 about software reuse must be always preserved and explored.
 Here's an interview with [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xrL2d5omuA).

## More is comming

Yup, I haven't finished writing it. Hold on a little.
